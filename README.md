# Random_Forest_Implementation
This project demonstrates how to use the Random Forest algorithm for classification using Python and scikit-learn.

The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training using RandomForestClassifier
- Evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix
- Visualization of feature importance

Itâ€™s a basic machine learning project to understand how ensemble methods like Random Forest work. Ideal for beginners learning supervised classification.

To run the project:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Random_forest.ipynb`)
2. Run the cells step-by-step
3. Make sure necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn are installed

This project is part of my machine learning practice.
